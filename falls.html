        <img src="falls.jpg" style="width: 300px;">
        <p style="font-size: larger;  word-spacing: 15px;">Hogenakkal, often referred to as the "Niagara Falls of India," is a majestic series of waterfalls situated on the Kaveri River in the Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu. The name is derived from the Kannada words hoge (smoke) 
            and kal (rock), inspired by the dense mist that rises as the water crashes against the ancient carbonatite rocks, which are considered some of the oldest in the world. Beyond its scenic grandeur, Hogenakkal is a cultural and wellness hub where visitors partake in traditional
             coracle (basket boat) rides to reach the foot of the falls, indulge in therapeutic herbal oil massages, and enjoy freshly caught river fish prepared by local vendors. The waters are locally believed to have medicinal properties due to the river's path through forest herbs, making it a
              popular destination for those seeking both adventure and rejuvenation.Whether you are walking across the hanging bridge for a panoramic view or standing at the base of the falls enveloped in "smoke-like" spray, the site offers a raw, powerful connection to nature. It remains a quintessential 
              weekend getaway for those looking to swap city noise for the thunderous roar of one of India's most powerful river systems.</p>
